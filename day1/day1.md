<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
Machine learning is the  science of programming a computer so that it learns from data

<b>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some
performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</b>

Example: spam filters, ats scorer

<H2>WHY</H2>
I. Repetitive tasks of dynamic nature

II. Too complex for traditional algorithms or no known algorithm
III.Eg. for voice typing, text to voice, fake documents


<h2>Types of algorithms based on supervisions</h2>

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regression is a statistical method that helps us to undertsands and predict the relation between variables</li>
<li>Describes how one variable(dependent->a.k.a feature) changes with change of another variable(independent)
